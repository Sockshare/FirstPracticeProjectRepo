Hello reader, this is me typing a message for
you to see. I don't know who will be the 
second one to see this. Maybe I will be the only one
to see it, aside from those who hack into my
comp. Oh well. Life is short, some sweet, some bitter.
But still absurd as ever. Why keep going? Is it
habit? Do we actually enjoy living? And why do we fear death?
It seems like we fear dying, and leaving everyone and everything 
behind. We will go on a journey in which no book can ever
be written about.
